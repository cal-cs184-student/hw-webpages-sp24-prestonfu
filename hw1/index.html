    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole.
      Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>



    <div align="middle">
      <figure>
        <img src="images/task1.png" width="400px" />

    </div>


    <p>The original unoptimized algorithm first finds the bounding box based on the minimum/maximum x and y coordinates
      of the triangle.
      Then, it loops through each pixel in the bounding box and tests if the center point is inside the triangle, using
      a series of three cross products to determine the relative orientation of each sample point to each triangle side
      and its opposite vertex.
      If the sample point is determined to be in the correct 3 half-planes, then the pixel is filled with the input
      color.
    </p>

    <p>The optimized algorithm does not use the bounding box or the half-plane technique to sample points. Instead, it
      first sorts the vertices from least to greatest y-coordinate.
      Then, it finds the sample pixels corresponding to the least and greatest y-coordinates and loops through them. At
      each sample y-coordinate, we then calculate the contiguous interval
      of pixel sample points that lay within the triangle. To do this, we first compare to the y-coordinate to the
      center vertex to determine which sides of the triangle bound the current
      horizontal slice. Then, we use the half-plane/cross product formula to evaluate the two bounding triangle sides at
      the given sample y-coordinate to determine the bounds on the x-coordinates.
      We then find the indices of the pixels that correspond to these coordinates and fill between them.
    </p>

    <p>This reduces the algorithm from performing three cross products for each pixel in the bounding box to performing
      two cross products for each row of the bounding box,
      which significantly reduces the computation. Furthermore, the bounding box of a triangle is at least twice the
      area of the triangle itself,
      so we expect the unoptimized algorithm to resolve at least twice as many pixels as the optimized algorithm, which
      only deals with pixels in the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>Below we include tables of timings for relevant SVG files. On the device these were tested on, we observed
      1,000,000 clock ticks per second.</p>

    <p>We also implemented the optimized algorithm for supersampling, and we include tables of timings below at a sample
      rate of 16 per pixel.</p>

    <p>Depending on the shapes of rasterized triangles, we observe speedup of at least 4x and up to 10x.</p>

    <p>We can also observe adherence to the OpenGL edge rules since we are inclusive on the left and exclusive on the
      right for intervals on both axes involving coordinates
      that lie exactly on a pixel sample coordinate.</p>



    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
    <p>For supersampling, we expanded our sample buffer by a factor of the sample rate. We then needed to modify our
      formula to calculate xy-coordinates from sample coordinates
      and from xy-coordinates into sample coordinates. The rest of the triangle rasterizing code was able to remain the
      same. Finally, we needed to modify the resolve_to_framebuffer
      function to average the colors of each pixel of the framebuffer. Effectively, this is a form of filter
      downsampling that aids with antialiasing and reduces jaggies by smoothing the signal.
    </p>

    <p>For lines and points, we had to modify fill_pixel to fill the entire set of samples corresponding to a pixel
      coordinate.</p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td align="middle">

            <figcaption>Sample rate = 1</figcaption>
          </td>
          <td align="middle">

            <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate = 4</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
        <tr>
          <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/task2_c.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate = 9</figcaption>
          </td>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>We can see that without supersampling the triangle misses many pixels which leads to floating pixel islands. When
      supersampling, we get subpixels that intersect the triangle
      which helps avoid the floating pixel island problem and instead blends the intensity of color as smoothly as
      possible given the resolution.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

    <p>
      Triangles are convex. As such, any point inside of them (or on the boundary) can
      be expressed as a convex combination of their vertices. That is,
      any point $P$ inside $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in the form
      $\alpha A + \beta B + \gamma C$, where $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$. The name of
      this format is barycentric coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is easy to convert from barycentric coordinates $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$
      to cartesian coordinates simply by evaluating the sum $\alpha A + \beta B + \gamma C$.
      The other direction is a bit more tricky: we have a system of three equations
      and three unknowns:
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      $\alpha A_x + \beta B_x + \gamma C_x = P_x$
      <br />
      $\alpha A_y + \beta B_y + \gamma C_y = P_y$
      <br />
      $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$
    </div>

    <p>
      The benefit of this approach is that we can generalize the approach to values.
      Suppose we have some assigned values, e.g. colors, at the vertices, called $V_A$,
      $V_B$, $V_C$. Then the value we assign at $P = (\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ is
      $\alpha V_A + \beta V_B + \gamma V_C$. For example, if $P = (1, 0, 0) = A$,
      then $V_P = V_A$. The result is that we can linearly interpolate values, which
      is nice for producing gradients. See the figure below.

    </div>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>
      Pixel sampling enables us to apply textures to images by mapping each point $(x, y)$ on
      an image to a corresponding point $(u, v)$ on the texture map. Since pixels and
      texels are discrete, and the maps have potentially different sizes, we must be careful
      about how we assign pixel colors based on texels.

      Two common pixel sampling methods are nearest and bilinear sampling. In nearest neighbor
      sampling, the color of the pixel on the texture is the color of the nearest corresponding
      texel. Bilinear sampling assigns colors as a weighted average of the colors of the four
      nearest texels surrounding the corresponding point. The weights are given by the distances
      between the mapped point and surrounding pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
      An example of these sampling methods is as follows.
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>

        <br>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <h3>Bilinear</h3>
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="images/bilinear1.png" align="middle" width="400px" />

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      At 1 sample per pixel, there is a clear improvement of bilinear over nearest,
      where the white lines get blended quite poorly (the color change from terrain to white
      occurs over just one pixel, whereas in the bilinear case it is more gradual).
    </p>

    <p>
      At 16 samples per pixel, nearest sampling has greater variation in the colors along the
      white contours than bilinear sampling. That is, the texture is sampled more uniformly
      in the bilinear case, resulting in smoother color changes and avoids systematic
      texture recoloring problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      An example of a considerable difference between the two methods is with magnification.
      Magnifying an image by 2x will lose considerable information using nearest sampling,
      since it will select every other texel as in the original. On the other hand,
      bilinear interpolation will incorporate information from surrounding texels, and as such
      would produce smoother transitions and less noticeable artifacts.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

    <p>Level sampling uses mipmaps to reduce aliasing. When using traditional texture sampling, an extreme rotation of a
      texture relative to the camera can result in pixels on the
      screen that overlap multiple texels on the texture. This results in aliasing, since our sample rate becomes much
      larger than the resolution of the texture. To resolve this,
      we can generate filtered mipmaps by averaging chunks of texels on the original texture such that we can have
      pixels that overlap a low constant number of texels by picking
      a better suited mipmap.
    </p>

    <p>To do this, we estimate the area on the texture represented by the pixel by finding the distance to adjacent
      pixels on the uv map, and approximating with a square with side
      length equal to the larger distance. By finding the log2 of this area, we can then estimate the mipmap that best
      reduces aliasing by rounding the log to the nearest integer.
      To create smoother transitions for animation, we can alternatively interpolate between two adjacent mipmaps using
      this log value.
    </p>

    <p>Overall, we end up with three techniques, which are "level zero", "nearest", and "linear". Level zero is the
      fastest, since it requires no math and a single texture lookup.
      Nearest and linear require similar computation, but linear requires two texture lookups while nearest only
      requires one texture lookup. Both nearest and linear require mipmap
      generation and storage, which will require 33% more memory. Linear has the most antialiasing power and is most
      effective for animation, but nearest seems to be a good approximation.
      Level zero can result in significant aliasing.
    </p>

    <p>We can see that the antialiasing is apparent for the fur at the edges of the cat, and we achieve the least
      aliasing for nearest level sampling and bilinear pixel sampling.</p>
